# VoxelPlay
(C) 2018 Ramiro Oliva (Kronnect)

Voxel Play is commercial software. Read the following rules to understand the purpose of this repository.

This repository is provided as popular request to licensed users of Voxel Play only.
It pursues two goals:

1) Make easier to integrate Voxel Play updates into your code base. By pulling only the latest changes into your project and not the entire package, you avoid the tedious work of manually merging your own code with Voxel Play everytime a new update of Voxel Play is released. This prevents losing custom changes you might have done to Voxel Play sources.

2) It's also allowed to submit PRs. By submitting your contributions to this repository, you can contribute to bug-fixing or adding features that you will be using in your game and that could require some changes into the core of Voxel Play.

Please note that not every contribution will be accepted - contributions must follow a previous discussion and be aligned with the purpose and roadmap of Voxel Play. They can be rejected if they are not a good fit for Voxel Play (ie. a feature that's not related with the voxel engine itself can could be developed as a different asset).

Only users that have signed the Voxel Play Contributor Agreement are allowed to access/use this repository.
